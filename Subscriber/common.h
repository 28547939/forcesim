        Endpoints are kept in a global map and subscribers check an endpoint's refcount during 
        subscriber destruction. An endpoint that is no longer used will be deleted. Multiple uses
        of the same UDP endpoint will reference the single Endpoint object representing that 
        UDP endpoint, as stored here.

        We use this separate "Endpoints" class to allow both the AbstractSubscriber and Subscribers classes 
        to access the endpoints map. AbstractSubscriber should have access to allow automatic Endpoint 
        refcount decrementing when a subscriber is destroyed, since that functionality is the same
        across all subscribers.
        The static Subscribers class (see below) needs access in order to create the Endpoint when an 
        AbstractSubscriber instance is added, and in order to emit the  JSON records that are processed 
        by the subscribers.

        Keeping the map in this separate class allows us to share the data without giving AbstractSubscriber
        or Subscribers friend access to one another.
