# the info_sequence item is required
# it specifies the sequence of lists of info objects to emit to the Market
#    between each iter block
# the first list in info_sequence is emitted before the first iter_block, and so on
# 
# info_sequence also implicitly indicates the total number of iter_blocks. after all items
# in info_sequence have been emitted, we stop. 
# elements of info_sequence can be empty if desired
